            <h2>Why did we start our project?</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wondered how good your phone is? (or) How does it compare to other devices in its category?</br>

                Every device specializes in a particular field. Like humans, devices aren't always jack of all trades, and hence can not please anyone and everyone.</br>So how can you find the device that suits you, that defines you, that understands you, and fulfills all your needs without making you ever feel as if you are compromising  just because you didn't have that particular information about your device when you needed it the most.
                </br>

            <h2>What we need your help for?</h2>
            <p>
                As you might know, helping you find your device requires a lot of information.</br> From the views of your best friends to the views of a professional wrestler, we intend to take all the information we receive and push through.</br> We wish for you to also be a part of this escapade, and help many others just like you to finally obtain their true devices without any issues.

                Thus lay down your wisdom and help us answer a few questions in the following survey.</br>

                Recommend it to friends, family, and the people you hate (cuz they are also information).</br> And help us create a database that will rival the worlds supercomputers, and who knows with the collective effort of mankind we might just be able to find your perfect match.
